while ago people had the idea to introduce fallible traits for GPIO pin to\nallow the implementation of virtual pins and port expanders. In this blog I'm\ndemonstrating how to convert an existing implementation to the v2 version of\nthe traits.\nSome background\nEmbedded HAL (embedded-hal\non crates.io) contains a number of traits specifying the interface to implement\nand use peripherals usually found on embedded devices. The digital traits in\nparticular define functions/methods to be used to both read the electrical\nstate of an input pin as well as change the electrical state of an output\npin.\nNow a pin might not be necessarily a thing which directly corresponds to\nsome local memory at the device the program itself is running on but might be\nmanaged by a remote chip. The big difference is that usually with a local pin\nthere's really nothing that can go wrong when reading or changing state as long\nas you can access the memory location related to it[1]. This all changes if the\npin is not under direct control, e.g. because you're using something like my\nembedded-bridge or a GPIO exander chip like the\nPCF857x, in which case there are number of\nreasons which a seemingly operation like reading the state might actually fail\nand you want to convey that information to the user of the HAL implementation.\nThis is why people decided to introduce a new version of the digital traits\nto convey errors along. The new traits were introduced in the version 0.2.3\nof embedded-hal which came with quite a bit of controversy due to the patch\nlevel only bump together with a rather prominent (and thus potentially\nannoying) deprecation warning.\nBut since digital::v2 is here to stay, let's see how we can actually make the\nswitchover.\nSwitching versions\nThe following steps are excertps from the nrf51-hal conversion, so if you'd\nlike to follow along you are invited you to check out this\ncommit.\nSo let's get started...\nUse the right version of the traits\nIn order to use digital::v2 rather than digital::v1 you either need to\nspell out the version explicitely all the time or you may want to change a use\nstatement to import the correct version into the namespace.\nSo before I used:\nuse embedded_hal::digital::{InputPin, OutputPin, StatefulOutputPin};\n\nand I switched that over to:\nuse embedded_hal::digital::v2::{InputPin, OutputPin, StatefulOutputPin};\n\nChanging function signatures\nSince the new versions always return a Result and the Err part of the\nResult may vary, there's now an associated Error type which needs to be\nspecified.\nSince (as mentioned before) for direct MCU pins the operation usually\ninfallible I'm specifying the type to be core::convert::Infallible, so we're\nchanging from:\nimpl&lt;MODE&gt; OutputPin for $PXx&lt;Output&lt;MODE&gt;&gt; {\n\nto:\nimpl&lt;MODE&gt; OutputPin for $PXx&lt;Output&lt;MODE&gt;&gt; {\n    type Error = Infallible;\n\nand then of course we need to change the functions to return a result, too, so\nwe go from:\nfn set_high(&amp;mut self) {\n    ...\n}\n\nfn set_low(&amp;mut self) {\n    ...\n}\n\nto:\nfn set_high(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Result&lt;(), Self::Error&gt; {\n    Ok(...)\n}\n\nfn set_low(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Result&lt;(), Self::Error&gt; {\n    Ok(...)\n}\n\nOf course in some cases it's slightly more complex because the is_* methods\nare often implemented based on the other implementation and now we need to take\ninto account that we're not just inverting a truth value but working with a\nResult so we might have to go from:\nfn is_set_high(&amp;self) -&gt; bool {\n    !self.is_set_low()\n\nto something like this:\nfn is_set_high(&amp;self) -&gt; Result&lt;bool, Self::Error&gt; {\n    self.is_set_low().map(|v| !v)\n}\n\nPrelude\nAn additional thing you might want to do is to make sure that you add the used\ndigital traits to the prelude of the HAL impl so users can simply use the new\nimpls without much fuzz.\nSo here we add the following to src/prelude.rs:\npub use embedded_hal::digital::v2::InputPin as __nrf51_hal_rng_InputPin;\npub use embedded_hal::digital::v2::OutputPin as __nrf51_hal_rng_OutputPin;\npub use embedded_hal::digital::v2::StatefulOutputPin as __nrf51_hal_rng_StatefulOutputPin;\npub use embedded_hal::digital::v2::ToggleableOutputPin as __nrf51_hal_rng_ToggleableOutputPin;\npub use embedded_hal::digital::v2::toggleable as __nrf51_hal_rng_toggleable;\n\nBump the minor version\nThis these changes will be breaking for your users you definitely want to well\ndocument the change, at least by bumping the minor version so people will not\nsimply run nasty and unexpected troubles when compiling their code.\nAnd with this you are done and I hope to see you again on my blog soon.\n[1]: There might be some security features thwarting that direct acces but in the vast majority of cases this not a problem\n","id":"https://therealprof.github.io/blog/digital-v1-to-digital-v2/","title":"Converting an Embedded HAL impl from digital::v1 to digital::v2 traits"},"https://therealprof.github.io/blog/e32-868t20d/":{"body":"I've recently set up a gateway for The Things Network and to spice things up\na bit a was looking into possibilities of hooking up some microcontroller based\nboard to it. So it started to look into options how to make this happen.\n\nAs it turns out, Semtech is one of the biggest manufacturers of LoRaWAN capable\nIP cores which are also used by a lot of manufacturers in one way or another.\nSo I was hoping I would find a SX1276 based board somewhere in my\ndrawer but unfortunately I only found RAK811 boards which are kind of\nexpensive boards which already come with a microcontroller implementing a\nsophisticated LoRA/LoRAWAN stack requiring interfacing and a E32-868T20D\nmodule from EByte which does something similar but in a much more primitive\nand mostly useless way.\nThis is what it looks like:\n\n\n\nSince EByte claimed that this is module contains a SX176 based design paired\nwith premium components, I'd say we have a look under the hood and see whether\nwe can make it useful for us; shall we?`\nUnder the hood\nSo with a bit of fiddling (and the help of SRA chip removal alloy) I removed\nthe metal shield and was greeted with these components on the board:\n\n\n\nFrom left to right we can see:\n\nThe SMA connector\nA discrete filter and impedance matching network (look at those beautiful wirewound inductors!)\nThe SX1276\nA crystal\nA STM8L151G microcontroller\nTwo 3V3 voltage regulators\nVarious decoupling caps and resistors\nThe 2.54mm pin headers to hook up to a MCU or USB to serial interface\n\nA few noteworthy things here: First of all, it's a really beautiful, well\nstructured and clean design, the SX1276 and the antenna interface are textbook\nand use really high quality components. For whatever reason EByte has chosen\na rather powerful and expensive STM8L151G microcontroller for such a dumb\njob. The reason for the two (and different brand!) 3V3 regulators is that one\nis for the MCU and the other one for the SX1276 which is actually conntrolled\nby the microcontroller and only turned on when communication is required.\nReversing the module\nThe module is a bit annoying in that the serial interface is rather useless. It\nonly supports a P2P LoRA mode so it can only talk to another module of its kind\n-- pretty much. So my idea was to figure out what's happending under the hood,\nremoving the serial interface and wire up the SPI interface of the SX1276 for\ndirect use. \nSo here's the important bits marked up:\n\n\n\nSo basically we should be able to connect the SCK, MISO and MISO pins\nfrom the SX1276 directly to the AUX, TXD and RXD pins, permanently turn\non the second LDO and everything should work just fine.\nMod the module\nSo here's the modded version:\n\n\n\nI decided to remove the LDO for the STM8L151G as there's really no point in\nhaving a second one which just adds to the noise and draws current all the\ntime. Then I'vve used shame wire to cross from the signals coming over from the\nSX1276 to run them directly into the previous output pins of the STM8L151G. \nThe RESET pin I simply bridged over to M0, for this the former LDO line had\nto go, otherwise that'd be connected to the LDO which is probably not good\nfor power sequencing reasons. Last but not least the LDO was set to be\npermanently on.\nOf course everything was tested for shorts and proper voltages/power\nconsumption so until I can test it via software I'm going to assume it was\nsuccssfully converted.\nNext steps\nOf course now we'll need some proper Oxidization and turn to writing some Rust\nsoftware. I actually found two implementations, one from Rust Embedded WG\nmember Ryan Kurte radio-sx127x and one from Charles Wade sx127x_lora. So\nall that there's left to do is try them out.\nExciting times.

Wonder no more because now there's a approach on the horizon and\nthis first article will explain the concept behind that...\nThe idea\nAs mentioned in the intro, the usual development cycle can get a bit long in\nthe tooth if all you want to do is quick prototyping, test, write a driver or\nanything else in an iterative way for microcontrollers. Not only does\nno_std development create some additional restrictions which require\nadditional effort working around but you'll also be faced with slightly less\nhelp from code editors, slightly more involved processes to flash and run the\ncode (also coming with additional delays), hit the occasional out-of-flash\nbarrier (especially when you'd like to use a debugger and hence should use\ndev builds) and generally have a lot less visibility about what is actually\nhappening.\nTo get rid of many of those issues I had the idea of bridging between the\nhardware and a regular computer, granting full access to many MCU peripherals\nfrom applications running on the latter. So all one has to do is flash a\nspecial firmware once to the microcontroller and everything else will be\ncontrolled by software running on the computer; of course using the same\nembedded-hal interface one would use on the microcontroller, so whenever the\napproach is developed/tested/proven, it can be implemented directly on the\nMCU.\nIntrigued? Read on then...\nThe concept\nAs mentioned before the concept consists of a hardware specific firmware\nrunning on the MCU as well as something which provides the embedded-hal\ninterface on the computer. Now you may wonder how those two elements will be\nable to communicate with each other... In this concept that gap is bridged by a\nthird component which serialises peripheral specific commands and results which\nare then transferred using any available streaming or packetized channel.\n\nBroken down we have three crates:\n\nBridge Host: This is a crate to be used on a developer machine which provides implementations for the embedded-hal traits, based on a user provided communication channel (at the moment only serial, but USB is already planned and further channels are possible, e.g. BLE, Ethernet, WiFi...). The peripherals and their capabilities are created on the fly and negotiated with the Bridge Firmware.\nBridge Common: This crate is #[no_std] and used both by the Bridge Host and also by the Bridge Firmware. It contains the de-/serialisation of the protocol and is used to ensure that both ends are using a compatible protocol.\nBridge Firmware: This crate implements a #[no_std] firmware for microcontrollers (at the time of writing only for STM32F042), ingesting all peripherals and managing them via the remote protocol.\n\nPossible uses\nThere are lots of uses but one of the main uses is certainly prototyping on the\nhost and writing new drivers. Of course one could always find a Raspberry Pi\nsomewhere, put in an SD card, install Rasbpian, install a Rust toolchain and\n(slowly) develop natively on the Pi but it's still rather limited compared to\ndevelopment on a real development machine.\nAnother major usecase I can envision is cheap hardware interfacing: A cheap and\neasy to implement USB connected STM32F042 can do ADC, I2C, SPI, Serial, CAN,\nIR, HDMI CEC, I2S1 as well as various GPIO modes and Timer/PWM tricks.\nAlso it is possible to extend the reach of a microcontroller quite a bit by\nremoving the #[no_std] restrictins and flash/RAM size limitations by using a\nregular computer for the heavy lifiting.\nOf course the major disadvantage of the concept is speed; anything requiring\nshort and defined reaction times will simply not be possible with this kind of\nsetup. Also if you stop the host application, the microcontroller will simply\nstop, waiting for new commands.\nI plan to follow up this post by some example uses of mine.\nThe implementation\n⚠ WARNING ⚠: If you're easily offended by tons of deliberately unsafe\nRust code I would humbly suggest you abstain from continuing to read.\nI've posted a first crude version at embedded-bridge. It includes a firmware\nfor the STM32F042 MCU which works like a charm on the NUCLEO32-F042K6 and\nan blinking the on-board LED on that board over the serial port provided by the\non-board STLink and hooked up internally to the MCU. I also have code running\non the host driving a I2C SSD1306 display hooked up to the MCU.\nPull requests to clean up or implement new functionality are very much welcome!\nMore to come soon...\n","id":"https://therealprof.github.io/blog/embedded-bridge-part-1/","title":"Introduction into a new approach to develop with and for embedded devices"},"https://therealprof.github.io/blog/embedded-bridge-part-2/":{"body":"In the previous part I introduced the concept of embedded-bridge. Now let's\ndive a little bit deeper and have a look at a real life example.\nImplementation details\nLow level communication\nAs I mentioned, the concept is to bridge the hardware peripherals from the MCU\n(or target) over to the host via some available communication port which is\navailable both on the target and the host. The communication channel needs to\nbe bi-directional but other than that the sky is the limit.\nUART / serial port\nOne of the most common choices for communication with an MCU is a UART\ninterface with TTL voltages (usually 3.3 volts), often referred to as a \"serial\nport\". While no computer in the world offers a native 3.3V connection to other\ndevices this is predominant interface to talk to and program microcontroller\nof all kind or load bitstreams into FPGAs that a lot of manufacturers through a\nUSB to serial adapter chip onto a lot of boards or build it into their MCU\ndebugging interfaces. This makes it a natural choice for the first\nimplementation, so that's what it is.\nUSB\nAlso a lot of MCUs have USB support built-in which is fantastic because it\nallows direct connections from a computer to a MCU. It is harder to implement\nboth in the hardware design (since it usually requires additional care to\nobtain the precise clocks needed for USB) and on the software side but it is\nusually hardware assisted and thus a lot faster and more ubiquitous.\nembedded-bridge does not support it yet but this is one of the next items on\nthe todo list to make happen.\nBLE\nSomething which would be really nice to have but will not happen without\nvolunteers is Bluetooth Low Energy support. It's not the fastest protocol in\nthe world nor is it easy to handle but there're few MCUs out there which\nnatively support it and adding support would allow any modern laptop or mobile\nphone to use embedded-bridge entirely remotely which would be really nice.\nEthernet / WiFi\nQuite a few chips have built-in Ethernet or WiFi or allow easy external\nadditional of such interfaces. Similarly to BLE this would allow remote control \nover the embedded-bridge, but unlike BLE this could also be done out of the\nreach of BLE from far away which would also be nice to have.\nHigher level protocol\nAt the higher level the bridge-common submodule provides serializable enums\nwhich are turned into efficient binary code with the help of serde and postcard.\nThe enums are \"task based\", so each action which can be taken at a peripheral\nwill receive their own enum. This includes initialization, setting, clearing,\nsending and receiving per peripheral type.\nBy having bridge-common implemented as a no_std compatible module this can\nboth be used on the firmware and on the host side, ensuring that both parties\nare implementing the protocol in the exact same way. The latest updates also\ninclude versioning, allowing the host to ensure that the firmware is running on\nthe same version of the protocol before attempting to use it.\nTo make things even more obvious (and the peripheral use fully transparent),\nthe host side allows for en- and decoding of all packets, allowing to trace all\ndata exchange between the host and peripherals; we'll see more about this with\nthe example later.\nThe serialized data is pushed over the lower layer, picked up at the target,\ndecoded, processed, a reply encoded and sent back the host over the same\nchannel.\nOn the target side all processing is going through the HAL abstraction, albeit\nwith some trickery to simplify the state handling dramatically; if I find a way\nto address this I'll do it but it's quite likely that it will stay that way.\nOn the host side one can either use a high level-ish API or and embedded-hal\ncompatible abstraction layer on top of it which allows to use (or develop)\nregular drivers directly on the host.\nA first example\nMeet the hardware\nMy development platform of choice is the STM Nucleo32-F042K6 which is a cute\nlittle and very affordable little board consisting of a STMicroelectronics\nSTM32F042 ARM Cortex-M0 MCU and a ST-Link/V2 debugger in a breadboard friendly\nform factor. The MCU is not only very feature rich and cheap, it is also very\nmaker friendly, which makes it one of my go-to choices for simple custom\nhardware designs. The built-in ST-Link debugger with USB serial support (and\ninternal serial connection between ST-Link and MCU) also makes it usable\nout-of-the-box for this purpose. It even supports crystal-less USB, however\nthere's no second USB socket on the board to use that.\nThe example in this blog post can be directly followed with this board.\nGetting started\nYou can follow along all examples by checking out the embedded-bridge\nrepository. I'll only highlight the important bits and commands here.\nAfter checking out the repository the first step is to flash the generic\nfirmware onto the MCU. To do this, you'll have to change into the\nembedded-firmware subdirectory and (after installing all the tooling for\ncompiling Rust code on a Cortex-M0 MCU) compile it:\ncargo build --release\n\nThe binary will end up in\n../target/thumbv6m-none-eabi/release/bridge-firmware and needs to be\nflashed to the target (after hooking it up via USB that is):\nopenocd -f nucleo.cfg -c \"init\" -c \"targets\" -c \"reset halt\" -c \"program ../target/thumbv6m-none-eabi/release/bridge-firmware verify reset exit\"\n\nIf this was successful you should see something like:\nInfo : clock speed 1000 kHz\nInfo : STLINK V2J31M21 (API v2) VID:PID 0483:374B\nInfo : Target voltage: 3.260853\nInfo : stm32f0x.cpu: hardware has 4 breakpoints, 2 watchpoints\nInfo : Listening on port 3333 for gdb connections\n    TargetName         Type       Endian TapName            State\n--  ------------------ ---------- ------ ------------------ ------------\n 0* stm32f0x.cpu       hla_target little stm32f0x.cpu       halted\n\nInfo : Unable to match requested speed 1000 kHz, using 950 kHz\nInfo : Unable to match requested speed 1000 kHz, using 950 kHz\ntarget halted due to debug-request, current mode: Thread\nxPSR: 0xc1000000 pc: 0x0800325c msp: 0x20001800\nInfo : Unable to match requested speed 1000 kHz, using 950 kHz\nInfo : Unable to match requested speed 1000 kHz, using 950 kHz\ntarget halted due to debug-request, current mode: Thread\nxPSR: 0xc1000000 pc: 0x0800325c msp: 0x20001800\nInfo : Unable to match requested speed 8000 kHz, using 4000 kHz\nInfo : Unable to match requested speed 8000 kHz, using 4000 kHz\n** Programming Started **\nInfo : device id = 0x10006445\nInfo : flash size = 32kbytes\n** Programming Finished **\n** Verify Started **\n** Verified OK **\n** Resetting Target **\n\nOnce this is done, the setup is complete and you can now use the peripherals on\nthe host.\nUsing the peripherals from the host side\nLet's start with something simple, the good old blinky. The board contains an\nLED at PB3 so we can use that.\nBacking out of embedded-firmware and going to embedded-host we can now talk\nto the device via the built-in USB serial. To do so we create some boilerplate\nto talk to the USB serial adapter which you can find in any of the\nnucleo_f042 examples; just copy an example and you're good to go.  The\ninitialization should give you a serial port which we'll store in the variable\nport and will use from here on.\nYou should always start your code by assuring you're using the same version of\nthe protocol as the firmware flashed onto the target, this can be done with\nbridge_host::common::assert_version(port.clone());\n\nNow to the fun part. We can get a embedded-hal OutputPin compatible object\nfor said pin PB3 (the one connected to the green LED) by calling\nlet mut pin = bridge_host::gpio::PushPullPin::new(\"b3\".into(), port.clone());\n\nYou can pass this object to anything taking an object requiring the OutputPin\ntrait. You can either call the trait methods directly or pass it on to any\ndriver requiring such an object.\nFor now we're just going to blink it:\nloop {\n    pin.set_low();\n    std::thread::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_millis(500));\n\n    pin.set_high();\n    std::thread::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_millis(500));\n}\n\nThis will turn the green LED off, wait for half a second (on the host), turn it\non again and wait another half a second before starting over.\nYou can compile and run the program like any other program you'd run on your\nlocal machine which for me is:\ncargo run --release --example nucleo_f042_gpio_blinky -- /dev/tty.usbmodem144423\n\nNow watch the LED blink and toy around as much as you'd like and I'll see you\nwith some more advanced article here soon...\n","id":"https://therealprof.github.io/blog/embedded-bridge-part-2/","title":"A deeper look into embedded-bridge with an example"},"https://therealprof.github.io/blog/interrupt-comparison/":{"body":"In this blog entry I will explain a bit what interrupts are and they work in\nembedded systems and compare various interrupt implementation and sharing\nmethods in Rust.\nUpdate 2020-03-06: @jamesmunns has provided a new version of cmim which\nallows to use the SysTick exception and an adaption of the example for it so\nI updated this post accordingly.\nInterrupt handling\nInterrupt\nAn interrupt is a hardware method to react to special events recognized by the\nsystem to interrupt regular program flow and do some special handling of the\nevent which caused the interrupt. This mechanism does not only exist for micro\ncontrollers but is also present on regular CPUs. On the latter it is used\nespecially by external components, e.g. extension cards or connected external\nperipherals which can notify the system about events (e.g. data to be\nprocessed is available) by generating an interrupt signal. The other common case\nis that interrupts are generated internally in the processing core by\nconfiguration of certain trigger events, e.g. if some memory access violation\nhappened, some timer expired or the transmit buffer is empty.\nTo enable the use of interrupts on a system there's a special hardware element\ncalled an interrupt controller which can be programmed to handle such special\nevents happening in the system. Interrupts have a defined or configurable\npriority and whenever an interrupt is generated with a higher priority than\nwhat the current execution priority, then the ongoing execution flow will be\nsuspended and execution continues at a special function called an interrupt handler...\nInterrupt handler\nAn interrupt handler is a special function which is\ndesigned to handle one or multiple of the interrupt types an interrupt controller can\nsupport. During the execution of an interrupt handler the regular program\nexecution is suspended and all processing resources are dedicated to the interrupt\nhandler. Most interrupt controllers are so called nested interrupt\ncontrollers which means that the execution of an interrupt handler can also be\nsuspended to work on an even higher priority interrupt, should one occur.\nAs you can imagine, in a system where multiple priority levels exist, this can\nbe problematic. If a part of the program is working with a resource, gets\nsuspended and then an interrupt handler takes over and works with the same\nresource, this can easily cause race conditions.\nThere're multiple ways around this and we'll talk about this later but for now\nI'll briefly mention the two simplest solution for single-core systems\n(multi-core systems can execute code in parallel which causes additional problems):\n\nLet everything run on the same priority: Without preemption there can't be\ndata races (between interrupt handlers, at least)\nDisable interrupts temporarily. This is called a Critical Section (or CS) and\nwe'll see this a few times in a bit.\n\nAt the end of the interrupt handler, execution will continue at the last suspension point.\nResource sharing\nThere're essentially two pieces of resources you might you might want to \"share\"\nbetween interrupt handlers and regular code. It is essential to appropriately\nmanage access from different parts of the program to them, especially for a\nlanguage like Rust which takes safety very seriously.\nResource types\nThere're two important classes of data which we need to consider:\nData\nData can be any structure located at some address in random access memory. Those can be simply variables\nbut also more complex structures like buffers where data piles up until it can\nbe processed by a different piece of code.\nPeripherals\nIn typical micro controllers all peripherals are accessible via memory mapped\naddresses which means that these magic addresses do interact directly with\nhardware when written to or read from. \nAccess management\nThere're 3 essential mechanisms to manage access to those resources:\nUniqueness\nEvery function, interrupt handler, memory address, etc. can only exist once. For\nthe most part Rust already guarantees that this is the case, however it can not\ndo this for raw pointers to memory addresses which is the reason why it is\nunsafe to dereference them into concrete types. However we do want to\nhave access to those memory locations but still obtain unique handles to those\nresources which Rust will help us to deal with, so how do we do this?\nThe trick is that we're mapping those memory mapped addresses into concrete\ntypes which give us the required abstraction to safely use those and in addition\nwe wrap them into a singleton so it's only possible to (safely) obtain the whole\nset of resources exactly once and let the Rust compiler handle most of that for us.\nSharing\nUsually sharing resources in Rust is simple, you just pass borrows around and\nthe Rust borrow checker will ensure that the lifetimes of the borrowed resources\nare not mixed up and that a mutable borrow and a regular borrow are mutually\nexclusive.\nHowever things get more tricky if there're non-linear program flows involved as\nit is the case with threads and interrupt handlers. As soon as there's an\nexternal party involved which can interfere with program execution flow like a\noperating system scheduler or interrupt controller, all shared resources require\nspecial protection which know how to deal with a particular case. For threads we\nhave the Sync trait to cover concurrent access however this assumes that there\nis an overseeing party which makes sure that some over-the-top guarantees are\nupheld, however there're cases in embedded where this cannot not work.\nMoving\nSimilarly to sharing, moving now becomes a problem because the Rust compiler\ncannot track resources which are supposed to move into e.g. an interrupt handler.\nTo the Rust compilers' eye those are not even part of the program itself but\nmore a kind of standalone functions which are never even called and for some weird\nreason just happen to be defined in the same code base are the \"real\" program.\nSilly developers!\nSo special precautions need to be applied to a resource which is initialized in\nonce part of the \"real\" program but then supposed to move to a different\nlocation which is not seen as part of the \"real\" program but a weird function\nwhich seemingly unused.\nImplementation approaches\nOver the last couple of years a few mechanisms have been developed and evolved\nto deal with the implementation and handling of the before mentioned shenanigans\nin a sane way.\nFor the rest of the post I will look at different approaches to handle\ninterrupts, share and move resources. For this I've developed a simple example\napplication for a Cortex-M0 MCU and we will look at the different\nimplementations with the different approaches, compare the generated code sizes\nand I will give you my opinion about the pros and cons of the various methods.\nSo this is what the end result will have to look like:\n\nAll of the code can be found in the interrupt-comparison repo under the\nflashing workspace.\nSo these are the contenders:\nCortex-m-rt with delay\nThis is almost the most basic approach one could take without interrupts or an\nkind of sharing and thus our primitive \"baseline\":\n\nSet up the hardware and a timer\nBusy-wait for the timer to expire\nTurn LED on or off\n\nCode\n#![no_main]\n#![no_std]\n\nuse panic_halt as _;\nuse stm32f0xx_hal::{delay::Delay, prelude::*, stm32};\nuse cortex_m::peripheral::Peripherals;\nuse cortex_m_rt::entry;\n\n#[entry]\nfn main() -&gt; ! {\n    if let (Some(mut p), Some(cp)) = (stm32::Peripherals::take(), Peripherals::take()) {\n        let mut state: u8 = 0;\n\n        let (mut led, mut delay) = cortex_m::interrupt::free(|cs| {\n            // Configure clock to 48 MHz (i.e. the maximum) and freeze it\n            let mut rcc = p.RCC.configure().sysclk(48.mhz()).freeze(&amp;mut p.FLASH);\n\n            // Obtain resources from GPIO port A\n            let gpioa = p.GPIOA.split(&amp;mut rcc);\n\n            // (Re-)configure PA5 as output\n            let led = gpioa.pa5.into_push_pull_output(cs);\n\n            // Get delay provider\n            let delay = Delay::new(cp.SYST, &amp;rcc);\n\n            (led, delay)\n        });\n\n        loop {\n            if state &lt; 10 {\n                // Turn off the LED\n                led.set_low().ok();\n                state += 1;\n            } else {\n                // Turn on the LED\n                led.set_high().ok();\n                state = 0;\n            }\n            delay.delay_ms(100_u16);\n        }\n    }\n\n    loop {\n        continue;\n    }\n}\n\nBinary results\nOptimized\nBloat for example flashing_delay\nFile  .text Size          Crate Name\n0.2%  74.5% 328B flashing_delay flashing_delay::__cortex_m_rt_main\n0.0%  14.5%  64B    cortex_m_rt Reset\n0.0%   1.4%   6B      [Unknown] main\n0.0%   0.5%   2B    cortex_m_rt HardFault_\n0.0%   0.5%   2B    cortex_m_rt DefaultPreInit\n0.0%   0.5%   2B    cortex_m_rt DefaultHandler_\n0.0%   0.0%   0B                And 0 smaller methods.

However to cover all of Cortex-M I specifically opted to use a\nCortex-M0 which lacks e.g. compare-and-swap options and thus resembles the\nlowest possible denominator for this particular vendor.\nYou can find all the code and tools used to conduct the tests in my repository\nat interrupt-comparison. Feel free to experiment and let me know your\nexperiences. Also let me know if you have another approach you feel should be\ncovered here.\nI was trying to include cmim in this comparison but I failed to get the\nSysTick exception to work and failed. If this gets addressed I might update\nthis blog post with another implementation.\nUpdate 2020-03-06: cmim is now included\nThanks for sticking with me for this long and I hope to see you another time around.\n","id":"https://therealprof.github.io/blog/interrupt-comparison/","title":"A look into ways to implement and share data with interrupt handlers in Rust (Update 1)"},"https://therealprof.github.io/blog/revamping-rust-embedded-error-handling/":{"body":"In this blog post we'll have a look at error handling in Rust embedded\nscenarios. How does this work at the moment, what are the user expectations\nand what can we do to make error handling future proof?\nIntroduction\nThere have been many great articles, discussions and talks about error handling\nRust in the last few months. The ecosystem has made great progress on that\nfront ever since the std::error::Error trait became powerful with the\nintroduction of the source method in 1.30.0 and the #[non_exhaustive]\nattribute in 1.40.0. I'm really amazed about the fantastic work and would\nhighly recommend to have a look at e.g. anyhow and thiserror to see some\nstate of the art possibilities, if you're not familiar with those achievements.\nBUT we're talking about embedded here and there're some notable differences\nto what is possible in the std world mentioned above. Some of these are:\n\nwe're restricted to no_std in embedded, i.e. libcore instead of libstd and there's no Error trait in libcore\nthere's no allocator, so we cannot use Box or any other types requiring a heap\nwe don't usually have an output medium, so all errors have to be machine read-/manageable instead of human-friendly\nerror kinds need to be common across all dependencies and composable, \"surprise\" errors can only be dealt with in the worst possible way\nsome common conditions which are not really errors are also signalled via the Err case in the Result\n\nOf course it needs also to be possible to easily bridge the gap between\nno_std and std since devices like a Raspberry Pi should also be able to use\nembedded device drivers, so we should not stray to far away from known\nterritory.\nThe current situation\nIn embedded we achieve composability by relying on the traits provided by the\nembedded-hal crate. This provides an interface between HAL implementations\nproviding the access to the hardware peripherals on one side and drivers and/or\napplications on the other side. In the current version most of the traits are\nfallible, in the upcoming version 1.0 there will only be fallible methods, so\nwe will always have a Result returning us any errors or other conditions from\nthe hardware peripherals or external components hooked up to those peripherals.\nHowever there's one slight snag: All error kinds are based on associated types\ndefined inside the traits. Take the serial::Read trait for example:\npub trait Read&lt;Word&gt; {\n    /// Read error\n    type Error;\n\n    /// Reads a single word from the serial interface\n    fn read(&amp;mut self) -&gt; nb::Result&lt;Word, Self::Error&gt;;\n}\n\nWhat this means is that the implementation defines its own error type and\nasssigns it as an associated type in its implementation. So every user of this\ntrait needs to know exactly what the Err kind type is and be able to handle\nthe relevant specific cases of that particular type, which is... not ideal.\nSo within an application the Result handling is specific to the HAL impl it\nis using. This might be okay in a few cases because you don't care about the\nnon-Ok case or you simply use wildcard handling for errors. Of course you\ncould also create a cfg-gated features mess to adapt to each possible\nhardware abstraction your application is supposed to run on.\nBut what if you want to write a generic driver which only depends those traits\nand does not even know which hardware it'll be running on and this particular\ndriver requires to handle specific conditions which can only be signalled using\nthe Err part? E.g. there're flash chips for the I2C bus which will return a\nNACK condition when they're currently busy processing a previous request. The\ndriver would know what to do when that occurs but it cannot know about the\ncondition, because it's part of a custom type only known to the HAL\nimplementation. The only thing a driver can do is forward the Err to the\napplication which might either not be able to cope with it in the context of\nthe driver or run into the previously mentioned problem again.\nHow to deal with the Err case in a generic way?\nIn order to address this problem with arbitrary unknown Err cases, I've\nproposed and created a new crate called embedded-error. The concept behind\nthat is based on the very same principles used by enum std::io::ErrorKind,\nwhich are:\n\nprovide an enumeration of simple and fixed error kinds\nuse the #[non_exhaustive] attribute to allow for non-breaking additions of error kinds at any point in time\n\nIn order to make it useful for embedded uses I introduced a few additional ideas:\n\neach category of peripheral gets they own dedicated set of error kinds\neach enumeration also contains a nested error kind Impl which is shared between different categories and used to signal implementation and/or environment specific problems\n\nThis allows us to have dependable Err types which everyone knows and which\nare able to convey an exact message to the user of an embedded-hal\nimplementation or driver and thus to handle errors efficiently and idependently\nof the target platform while being easily extendable at any point in the future\nwhenever the need arises.\nFuture plans for embedded-error\nAt the moment it is mostly a proof of concept and does by far not cover all\npossible peripherals and error kinds. But that's okay because as mentioned we\ncan add more types at any time and I'd highly encourage everyone to PR their\nfavourite error kinds to the embedded-error repository.\nI will also convert various HAL impls (like stm32f0xx-hal and\nstm32f4xx-hal, unless someone beats me to it 😉) to those error kinds because\nmost of those custom error kinds are very rudimentatry. So at least from a\ndocumentation and naming perspective such a change makes a lot of sense even\nthough we still have the associated type complication in embedded-hal for\nnow.\nOf course the final step would be general acceptance and use through\nembedded-hal by getting rid of the associated type. But quite frankly I'm\nvery tired of the discussion in Issue #229 (and in private) where the\ncurrent opinion is stuck in \"this is nice but not good enough for [insert\nhypothetical use case here], so let's rather do nothing at all\" limbo.\nPlease feel free to let me know your thoughts, either personally via the\navailable channels or via issues in the mentioned repositories. Of course I'd\nalso love to PRs implementing or furthering any of the mentioned things.\nSo long and until the next post. 👋\n","id":"https://therealprof.github.io/blog/revamping-rust-embedded-error-handling/","title":"Revamping Rust Embedded Error Handling － a case for embedded-error"},"https://therealprof.github.io/blog/roadmap-2021-arbitrary-size-primitives/":{"body":"In this blog entry following the Call for Rust 2021 Roadmap items, I\nshall layout my vision for giving Rust the ability to use arbitrarily sized\ninteger primitives.\nMotivation\nThis request has multiple motivations but following the Call for Rust 2021\nRoadmap items rules I'm notating them in the agile user story way:\n\nAs a system developer I want to be able to be able to use automatically range\nlimited types to prevent incorrect use and eliminate error checking\nAs an embedded developer I want to be able to safely represent memory-mapped\nregisters as bitfields\n\nSo let me give you a bit more background about the status quo and what I mean\nby those two stories before giving you my ideas how to address them.\nRange limited types\nIn a lot of areas it is quite common to have the desire to provide range\nlimited types whose allowed ranges do not coincide with the natural primitive\nbut still are a power of 2. E.g. say you want to provide an imaging library\nwhich is supposed to work with 3 components (R, G and B). The fact that\nwe have three components might already provide a hint at what I'm trying to get\nat...\nSo let's continue our exploration... A typical representation is RGB888 which\nmeans that each component consists of 8 bits (which is great since we can\nsimply use 3 u8s for that and by keeping the components separate we should be\nfine, and not have to worry about the combined representation of 24 bits).\nHowever, a lot of embedded displays only have a color depths of 16 bits in which\ncase the representation is usually something like (RGB565) which leaves us with\na number of options how to handle those values, neither of which is ideal.\nToday we could do:\n/// Values outside of the range will be clamped to the highest allowed\n/// component value\npub fn set_pixel_rgb565(&amp;mut self, r: u8, g: u8, b: u8) {\n    let (r, g, b) = (max(r, 31), max(g, 63), max(b, 31));\n    ...\n}\n\nor:\n/// Supplying components values outside the designated range are a\n/// definite grave user error\npub fn set_pixel_rgb565(&amp;mut self, r: u8, g: u8, b: u8) {\n    assert!(r &lt; 32);\n    assert!(g &lt; 64);\n    assert!(b &lt; 32);\n    ...\n}\n\nor:\n/// Supplying components values outside the designated range are a\n/// will yield a Result needed to be handled by the caller\npub fn set_pixel_rgb565(&amp;mut self, r: u8, g: u8, b: u8) -&gt; Result&lt;(), E&gt; {\n    if r &gt;= 32 || g &gt;= 64 || b &gt;=32 {\n        return Err(E::OutOfRange);\n    }\n    ...\n}\n\nNeither of the three cases are good and really just making a tradeoff of some kind.\nWhat we really want to do instead is:\n/// Rust will do the type-checking for us\npub fn set_pixel_rgb565(&amp;mut self, r: u5, g: u6, b: u5) {\n    ...\n}\n\nThis ensures that only correct types will be passed in and they have exact the\nsame behaviour as other all other \"natural\" primitives.\nBefore people will scream at me \"why don't you use the ux crate for this?\",\nI'd like to point out that this is rather incomplete and outdated and also I'm\nconvinced that the compiler can do a much better job at compile time to ensure\nthat incorrect uses of such types will be noticed at compile time instead of\npanicking at runtime.\nBut let's move on to the other use case...\nBitfields\nOne glaring omission in the Rust type system is the availability of bitfields\nwhich is arguably a MUST HAVE for any systems programming language.\nEspecially in embedded Rust we have thousands of memory-mapped-input-output\n(MMIO) registers which cram a number of different functions, identified by one\nor more bits, into a value located at a specific memory address. To access the\nindividual bits, other languages allow the (very unsafe) specification of\nstructures as bitfields while we in the Rust world have to use either gnarly\nmacros or gobs of Rust code (which also turn into gobs of binary code in dev\nmode, but I'll leave that to another Roadmap blog post maybe) and are\nsuperslow to compile.\nI don't bore you with details or pages of Rust code here, but if you're\ninterested in seeing real life code in use today for one single register(!)\nof of a STM32F042 MCU generated by svdrust, here's a gist: I2C1 CR1 svd2rust code.\nYou're also invited to browse the STM32F0 svd2rust crate docs which is\nconstantly getting in conflict with our docs.rs infrastructure due to the\nmassive amounts of code required.\nIt would be really cool if we could express the basic structure of such a MMIO\nregister by using the new primitive types in a regular struct:\n#[repr(u32)]\nstruct CR1 {\n    #[doc = \"Bit 0 - Peripheral enable\"]\n    pe: u1,\n    #[doc = \"Bit 1 - TX Interrupt enable\"]\n    txie: u1,\n    #[doc = \"Bit 2 - RX Interrupt enable\"]\n    rxie: u1,\n    #[doc = \"Bit 3 - Address match interrupt enable (slave only)\"]\n    addrie: u1,\n    #[doc = \"Bit 4 - Not acknowledge received interrupt enable\"]\n    nackie: u1,\n    #[doc = \"Bit 5 - STOP detection Interrupt enable\"]\n    stopie: u1,\n    #[doc = \"Bit 6 - Transfer Complete interrupt enable\"]\n    tcie: u1,\n    #[doc = \"Bit 7 - Error interrupts enable\"]\n    errie: u1,\n    #[doc = \"Bits 8:11 - Digital noise filter\"]\n    dnf: u4,\n    #[doc = \"Bit 12 - Analog noise filter OFF\"]\n    anfoff: u1,\n    #[doc = \"Bit 14 - DMA transmission requests enable\"]\n    txdmaen: u1,\n    #[doc = \"Bit 15 - DMA reception requests enable\"]\n    rxdmaen: u1,\n    #[doc = \"Bit 16 - Slave byte control\"]\n    sbc: u1,\n    #[doc = \"Bit 17 - Clock stretching disable\"]\n    nostretch: u1,\n    #[doc = \"Bit 18 - Wakeup from STOP enable\"]\n    wupen: u1,\n    #[doc = \"Bit 19 - General call enable\"]\n    gcen: u1,\n    #[doc = \"Bit 20 - SMBus Host address enable\"]\n    smbhen: u1,\n    #[doc = \"Bit 21 - SMBus Device Default address enable\"]\n    smbden(: u1,\n    #[doc = \"Bit 22 - SMBUS alert enable\"]\n    alerten: u1,\n    #[doc = \"Bit 23 - PEC enable\"]\n    pecen: u1,\n    // Need to always declare all bits according to `repr` size\n    _unused : u8,\n}\n\nLooks very nice and tidy, doesn't it? Of course we'll still need the accessor\nfunctions to differentiate between read-only and read-write fields but this\ngets rid of all the error prone bit-shifting and masking code.\nAnother usecase of this is real (and space-/execution efficient!) bitmaps:\n/// size_of::&lt;[bool; 10]&gt;() == 10\nlet arr : [bool; 10] = [false; 10];\n\n/// size_of::&lt;[u1; 10]&gt;() == 2\nlet arr : [u1; 10] = [0; 10];\n\nImplementation ideas\nObviously we cannot simply add a plethora of new primitives and be done with\nit, there're some problems with non-natural sized primitives:\n\nWe cannot (easily) calculate and use a pointer to such a type, so taking a\npointer would have to be forbidden\nThe compiler might (or might not) be bogged down if we add dozens or even\nmore than hundred new types (depending on how far we want to take this) so we\nmight potentially have to not enable those types by default and require\nexplicit use statements instead, which should be fine\nUsing a bitfield for MMIO might need some additional rules or some more\nand easier to find documentation than what's currently hidden in the nomicon\n... add your own here\n\nSome random to-dos I can think of from the top of my head:\n\nAllow #[repr(T)] on structs iff the sizes match\nAdd ux and ix types to the primitives\nProperly reflect them internally in the compiler so we can eliminate unnecessary bound checks\nIt might be possible to hook those types directly into LLVM to use by code generation backends\n\nTo avoid this blog from getting too long I'm going to turn this over to the\ncore team now for initial consideration.\nThanks for your attention and hope to blog to y'all soon!\n","id":"https://therealprof.github.io/blog/roadmap-2021-arbitrary-size-primitives/","title":"Rust Roadmap 2021: Allowing for arbitrary size integer primitives"},"https://therealprof.github.io/blog/roadmap-2021-usable-dev-mode/":{"body":"In this blog entry following the Call for Rust 2021 Roadmap items, I\nshall layout my vision for giving Rust the ability to create debuggable\nbinaries which will also fit in the flash of a microcontroller.\nMotivation\nThis request has multiple motivations but following the Call for Rust 2021\nRoadmap items rules I'm notating them in the agile user story way:\n\nAs an embedded developer I would like to be able to create debuggable applications\nAs an embedded developer I would also like to be able to create applications\nwhich fit into the very limited flash available to microcontrollers\n\nSo let me give you a bit more background about the status quo and what I mean\nby those two stories before giving you my ideas how to address them.\nDebuggable applications which fit into flash\nThe \"problem\" with Rust applications in general is that once even just the\nbare-minimum optimisations are enabled, the compiler will completely\nrestructure the whole application in a way that makes debugging hard or even\nimpossible.\nOn the other hand, if optimisations are completely disabled, rustc will\nhappily churn out code which is so highly inefficient and large that it either\nwon't fit in the available flash space or be so slow that crucial deadlines can\nnot be met (like USB handling) and the application will simply fail; quite\noften those two issues also rear their ugly heads at the same time.

This is done in the hope\nthat people will jump on it and drop the crapadelic boards known as \"BluePill\"\nlike a hot potato.\nForeword\nAs usual with ubiquitous hardware there's one company coming up with the idea\nand initial design and as soon as the product is out, a ton of (often) Chinese\ncompanies jump on and produce clones of (sometimes) questionable quality, often\nunderbidding the original company price-wise and thus destroying their business\ncase.\nI want to make it very clear that I do not endorse this kind of practise\nand recommend buying the original. For this reason I will make abundantly clear\nwhat the original is and only point to authentic sources. The original is in\nthis case not even more expensive so there's no excuse to buy a clone!\nIn this particular case we're talking about the STM32F4x1 MiniF4 from\nWeAct Studio. They do provide legitimate purchasing sources so I'd\nrecommend checking there if you're interested.\nThe hardware\nThe STM32F4x1 MiniF4 exists in two different variants, one with a STM32F401\nand one with a STM32F411 MCU. The STM32F401 has fewer resources and peripherals\nbut the look and feel as well as the handling is pretty much the same.\nSomeone has created a handy pinout sheet:\n\nA few things worth noting here:\n\nA beautiful design with bevelled edges, curvy traces, small SMD parts, proper and useful silk screen and ENIG (probably only on the higher end version)\nUSB-C is properly connected, also for data and we're going to make use of that\nThe underside has an unpopulated footprint for SPI flash if you want to add that\nThe STM32F4xx series has a proper USB bootloader in ROM so we can use the board without extra hardware\nThe current version always has 512kB of flash which is plenty\nWeAct Studio also provices a CMSDIS-DAP firmware, so if you get two boards you can turn one into a debugger and work on the other\nIt's not too obvious but the push button labelled KEY is hooked up to PA0\nThe high speed crystal clocks in at 25MHz, there's also a low speed crystal at 32.768kHz for the RTC\n\nGetting started\nThe setup is super simple which makes it easy to use for beginners. If you\ndon't have soldering equipment you probably want to find someone who can solder\nin the included headers which makes it a lot simpler to connect external\nhardware or put it on a breadboard but other than that you're ready to go.\nIn order to load (aka flash) software onto these boards there're a number of\noptions but I'm focusing on the two most promising approaches:\nThe easy route\nAs mentioned above the STM32F4x1 MCUs both have their USB-C connection properly\nwired and the built-in bootloader supports flashing directly over it and we\nhave the required buttons wired to trigger the procedure 👍, so that's what\nwe're going to do now.\nFirst off we need to have dfu-util installed; how to get them is left as an\nexercise to the reader. Then we should also have cargo-binutils installed\nwhich allows us to easily turn a binary into the required format for\ndfu-util.\nSo if we assume we're in the checked out stm32f4xx-hal repository and we\nwanted to flash the stopwatch-with-ssd1306-and-interrupts example to our\nboard (spoiler alert: This example will compile as is but not work fully\nwithout code changes) we'd do these three steps:\n\n# cargo objcopy --release --example stopwatch-with-ssd1306-and-interrupts --features=\"stm32f411,rt\" -- -O binary out.bin\n    Finished release [optimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.03s\n\nto compile the example for a STM32F411 MCU with --release profile and convert it to a binary file out.bin\nHold the NRST and BOOT0 buttons at the same time, then let go of NRST while still holding BOOT0 button for a second longer\n# dfu-util -a0 -s 0x08000000  -D out.bin\ndfu-util 0.9\n\nCopyright 2005-2009 Weston Schmidt, Harald Welte and OpenMoko Inc.\nCopyright 2010-2016 Tormod Volden and Stefan Schmidt\nThis program is Free Software and has ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY\nPlease report bugs to http://sourceforge.net/p/dfu-util/tickets/\n\ndfu-util: Invalid DFU suffix signature\ndfu-util: A valid DFU suffix will be required in a future dfu-util release!!!\nOpening DFU capable USB device...\nID 0483:df11\nRun-time device DFU version 011a\nClaiming USB DFU Interface...\nSetting Alternate Setting #0 ...\nDetermining device status: state = dfuERROR, status = 10\ndfuERROR, clearing status\nDetermining device status: state = dfuIDLE, status = 0\ndfuIDLE, continuing\nDFU mode device DFU version 011a\nDevice returned transfer size 2048\nDfuSe interface name: \"Internal Flash  \"\nDownloading to address = 0x08000000, size = 27904\nDownload\t[=========================] 100%        27904 bytes\nDownload done.\nFile downloaded successfully\n\n\n\nAfter pushing the NRST button again your program will run.\nThe powerful route\nOn the other end we have the ability to connect a debug probe and not only\nflash that way but also debug and use some of the fancy new capabilities\nprovided by the various probe-rs projects.\nIn order to use this route you will need to have a debug probe hardware around.\nThere're various routes to obtain one so I'm only going to mention the one\ninvolving the board we're already talking about.\nWeAct Studio published a CMSIS-DAP firmware for our board. Download it and\nmake sure have cargo-binutils installed. Then let's convert the downloaded\nfile to something dfu-util can handle:\n# rust-objcopy -Iihex -O binary CMSIS-DAP_WeActStudio.hex out.bin\n\nNow flash the out.bin as described above to another board. After a reset you\nhave debug probe available for our next steps.\nConveniently that CMSIS-DAP debug probe firmware uses the same pins for probe\noperation as the board to be debugged so by simply hooking up the four pins on\nthe end 1:1 to another board you're all set and can even power up the other\nboard. I also had success by not soldering any headers to the debug probe board\nand simply funnelling the other header through the holes and letting it sit at\nan angle. YMMV.\nWith that out of the way we can finally use all the goodies the embedded Rust\necosystem now has to offer, e.g. by installing cargo-flash we can now build\nand flash the firmware directly onto the board in a single step:\n# cargo flash --release --example stopwatch-with-ssd1306-and-interrupts --features=\"stm32f411,rt\" --chip stm32f411ceux\n    Finished release [optimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.03s\n    Flashing target/thumbv7em-none-eabihf/release/examples/stopwatch-with-ssd1306-and-interrupts\n        WARN probe_rs::architecture::arm::core::m4 &gt; Reason for halt has changed, old reason was Halted(Request), new reason is Exception\n        WARN probe_rs::architecture::arm::core::m4 &gt; Reason for halt has changed, old reason was Halted(Breakpoint), new reason is Request\n        WARN probe_rs::architecture::arm::core::m4 &gt; Reason for halt has changed, old reason was Halted(Request), new reason is Exception\n     Erasing sectors ✔ [00:00:00] [############################################]  32.00KB/ 32.00KB @  36.90KB/s (eta 0s )\n Programming pages   ✔ [00:00:02] [############################################]  28.00KB/ 28.00KB @   9.32KB/s (eta 0s )\n\nOf course flashing is just the beginning here but I won't go into debugging here.\nNext steps\nNow that we are acquainted with the hardware and the basic setup, it's time to\nwork on some software. I'll leave some concrete examples to follow up posts but\nof course I'm not going to hang out to dry here. 😄\nWe have excellent community support for these MCUs in [stm32f4xx-hal] from\nwhich I've also taken the example code above. If you're going to use this\nrepository directly, there're a few caveats to watch out for:\n\nYou need to specify the MCU every time you build an application\nThe flash and RAM settings are very conservative to fit all possible MCUs in the family but these boards have plenty of flash and RAM which are not going to be utilized\nSome examples don't work on all models and cargo doesn't allow to specify alternative options, if in doubt, adjust Cargo.toml.\nSome examples expect hardware to be connected to specific peripherals/pins and might need adjusting\nSome examples rely on semi-hosting and will thus not do anything useful out-of-the-box (also friends don't let friends use semi-hosting!)\n\nI'd highly recommend you start a new project and use stm32f4xx-hal as a\ndependency and set up everything to your liking in the project which will allow\nyou to make much quicker progress without a lot of stumbling blocks.\nIf you run into problems please join us on stm32-rs channel on Element.io,\nthere're always friendly people around (including me 😅) willing to help you\nout.\nThe finale\nI ordered these boards a while ago and let them sit around without paying too\nmuch attention however that was a big mistake. After some people mentioned them\nI decided to take a look and have to say I am impressed by the quality and the\nbang for the buck. Especially in comparison to the thing called a \"BluePill\"\nwhich exists in a ton of varieties with subtle (and not so subtle!) differences\nand generally bad quality and a lot of problems. These boards not only offer a\nbetter build quality, USB-C, built-in USB bootloader, more speed, more FLASH,\nmore RAM and more peripherals but a much better user experience, too, while\nstill being really affordable.\nStay tuned for more content using this board, I'll definitely use them every\nnow and then for various purposes.\n","id":"https://therealprof.github.io/blog/usb-c-pill-part1/","title":"Introducing: The USB-C pill"},"https://therealprof.github.io/welcome/":{"body":"What's this again?\nWelcome to yet another attempt to establish a blog type format about everthing\nembedded, electronics and of course Rust.\nI'll probably bring some of the previous content over for good measure but\ncontent gets outdated so fast it's not funny anymore.
